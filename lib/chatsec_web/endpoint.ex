  # Set only in config/prod.exs. Applied by hand below (instead of Phoenix's
  # own :force_ssl key, which it wires up unconditionally ahead of
  # `socket_dispatch`) because production put every websocket upgrade through
  # it too, and on chatsec.app's Cloudflare+Traefik chain the upgrade request
  # apparently doesn't carry the same X-Forwarded-Proto that a normal request
  # does — force_ssl saw it as plain HTTP and 301-redirected it to itself, a
  # response no browser's WebSocket client can follow. Every wss:// connection
  # to production failed this way. Traefik's own :80 entrypoint already
  # refuses plain HTTP before this app ever sees it, and a redirect is never
  # valid protocol behavior mid-handshake anyway, so the socket paths just
  # skip this plug entirely rather than depend on that header being correct.
  #
  # /health is exempted for the same underlying reason, discovered the same
  # way (a real production outage): Traefik's loadbalancer healthcheck
  # (compose.yaml) makes its own request directly to the container rather
  # than proxying real client traffic, so it never carries X-Forwarded-Proto
  # either. force_ssl 301-redirected every poll, and since Traefik doesn't
  # count a 301 as healthy, it pulled the container out of rotation and
  # stopped routing all real traffic to it - a self-inflicted full outage
  # caused by adding the healthcheck without exempting its own path here.
